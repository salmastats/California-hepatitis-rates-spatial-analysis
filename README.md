# California-hepatitis-rates-spatial-analysis
We will consider the distribution of hepatitis rates for the counties of California. The data are taken from the Department of Health Services of the State of California (1999). The rates are given as cases per 100,000 population, and are calculated by using 1998 data over the average population from 1995-1997.
